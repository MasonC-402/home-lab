# home-lab
proxmox-homelab, networking, DNS,SECURITY (Hardening and pentesting the server).It is pretty much an all in one project

## Feel free to give me any reccomendations. Currently I am implementing an internal DNS solution for my lan services (jellyfin, NAS, RetroArch, GitLab etc)
# I especially would appreciate any advice on security hardening both a cloud and on-prem server. Particulary if you have any real-world or homelab experience.
